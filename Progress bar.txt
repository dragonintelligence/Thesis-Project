Progress bar:
+ Got 3 papers I know for sure will reference -> all second pass
+ Wrote VisT code (still got to run it and evaluate)

Problems:
- Can't use DAS5
- Can't run on Collab (always have to extract ginormous zipfile)
- Running on CPU is slow
- Don't yet understand Perceiver
- Am too slow with finding & reading papers
